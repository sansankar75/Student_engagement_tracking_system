data="""[Teacher joins the call]

Teacher: "Alright... good morning everyone! Can you all hear me clearly?"

Student 1: "Yes, ma’am."

Student 2: "Yeah, all good!"

Teacher: "Great. So... today we’re going to talk about Artificial Intelligence — or AI for short."

[pause as teacher shares screen]

Teacher: "Okay, let me just... share my screen... and... there we go. Can you see the slide?"

Student 3: "Yep, it's visible."

Teacher: "Awesome. So... first things first — what exactly *is* AI?"

[pause for emphasis]

Teacher: "In simple words, Artificial Intelligence is... when machines are made to think... and act like humans. Not exactly like humans — but they try to mimic how we solve problems, make decisions, or even understand language."

[background mic crackle from a student joining late]

Teacher: "Now, there are two main types of AI. One is called *narrow AI*, which is designed to do one task — like Siri, or Google Maps."

Teacher: "The other is *general AI*, which doesn’t really exist yet — it would be a machine that could do *any* human-level task. Like learning languages, driving, painting... all without being told exactly how."

[pause, adjusts mic]

Teacher: "So far, we only have narrow AI — which is still very powerful."

Teacher: "Now... let’s take an example. When you ask Alexa to play music, what’s happening in the background is... speech recognition, natural language processing, and some decision-making. All that is AI."

Student 4: "Ma’am, does that mean AI can replace humans?"

Teacher: *laughs softly* "Good question! So... AI can *assist* humans, and in some areas, even automate tasks — but... replacing human thinking completely? We’re not there yet. And maybe we shouldn’t be!"

[pause]

Teacher: "Let me also show you a small video on how AI is used in real life — like in agriculture, health care, and even traffic control."

[pause as video loads]

Teacher: "And after the video, we’ll do a short quiz — don’t worry, it’s just 5 questions."

[pause again]

Teacher: "Alright, before we move on — any doubts so far?"

Student 1: "No, ma’am."

Student 3: "It's clear so far."

Teacher: "Great! So let’s continue..."""
